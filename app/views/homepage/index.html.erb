    <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
    <p>With a fresh renovation and a sixty-year old story, Amigo Motor Lodge is
      a perfectly nostalgic yet undeniably modern accommodation. Whether you
      select an original room or one of our additional Airstream trailers, the
      entire experience has been thoughtfully considered and nods to the history
      of the property and the area itself.</p>

    <h2>OUR SPACES</h2>
    <h3>about us</h3>
    <p>As our property was built in the 50's and 60s with smaller rooms situated
      next to the highway, occasional ambient noise can be heard. Our windows
      are old, and sometimes the floor might squeak. We operate in a similar
      manner to a good vacation rental, meaning that while there are generally
      staff around we aren't a full service property. Our lobby is attended and
      we're currently open to the public from 7:30AM-10PM most days. During off
      season we close at 8pm M-W. Our hot tub area closes 15 minutes prior to
      the office. We are now offering coffee and tea service with a limited grab
      and go style breakfast to help kick off your day in beautiful Salida.</p>
