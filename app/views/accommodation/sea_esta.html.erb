        <h3>House Overview</h3>
        <p>Our Marina Harbour Rooms come with their own private terrace, and
          sit within the seven-storey Marina Rise, a crescent-shaped residence
          designed with traditional South African flair. Choose an inviting
          king-size bed or two generous queen-size beds. Your en suite bathroom,
          complete with dual marble vanities, oval bath and invigorating rain
          shower, is the ideal place to unwind.
        </p>
        <p>If you can tear yourself away from the uplifting views of the harbour,
          indulge in a visit to the hotelâ€™s spectacular Spa Thermal Suites, an
          exclusive benefit for all our Marina Rise guests.
